# Geocoding
Reverse Geocoding for Client, using supplied Lat/Long information to return useable locations for assets in their portfolio.
Initial scope: Client has numerous assets, but inaccurate location information for those assets, making tracking and selling of assets quite difficult.

Job Scope:     Our service offering was to create a reverse geocoding program to draw information from a supplied Excel file containing all their assets' latitude and longitude information.
               We used ChatGPT to help create the said program using Python, having no experience in Python, we wanted to leverage AI promp engineering to create a solution to the initial scope.
               Development costs were for Inceptio (Pty) Ltd., hereafter The Comapny, as the program ownership remains with The Company.
               Once the program was running properly, and output was correctly generated and exported to an output Excel file, we had a product.

End result:    Initial scope was completed in record time.
               Customer files were created using the data we supplied, based on their supplied information.
               Customer was able to vastly improve their service offering, as well as cull any assets which were underperforming.
               Proper asset management for the client was top of the list of priorities.

Benefit:       The Company was able to learn a lot regarding what is possible leveraging AI and prompt engineering, helping create a program which is tiny in scope, but performs very well.
               Having no experience in coding or using AI, or AI Prompt Engineering, has allowed us to gain experience in adding value to our Customers' business.
               Using free services at first like Geopy as a test bed, then quickly realising the limitations of that service, we were able to keep development costs low.
               Continued development allowed us to move on to faster paid API's, which cut output time down 94%, from one return a second to 15 returns a second.
               Cost benefit was maximised.
